# nmf-data-plot
Plots data got from non-Negative Matrix Factorization codes

## Installation
All code has been tested on Linux, but it should work on Windows and macOS, 'cause it just uses the python environment.

So, you must install the following dependencies to run the tool:

* python3 (3.7 or later)
* python3-pip
* virtualenv (not essential)

Now, install the Python dependencies:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you don't want to share Python dependencies among other projects, you should use a virtual environment, such as [virtualenv](https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/).

At first, create a folder where you are going to install all Python dependencies:

`virtualenv -p python3 venv/`

Now, you have to activate it:

`source venv/bin/activate`

Finally, you can install the dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
